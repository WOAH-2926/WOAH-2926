## Thanks for visiting my Readme 👋

The purpose of this account is to facilitate learning. 
I am aiming to become a **cloud engineer**. 
Currently I am an L2/3 IT Specialist trying to break into more technical roles and away from end-user support!

######These are my current goals:
[] Get familiar with Git and Github
[] Get more familiar and comfortable using Linux and Linux commands
[] Get more comfortable with scripting (Bash, Powershell, etc.) 
[] Learn Python 
[] Obtain cloud certifications on the way (Currently focused on AZ-104 as that is what my workplace uses at the moment) 
[] Learn more about and gain familiarity with Docker, Kubernetes and all related 

And many more things that I cannot think of at the moment but are relevant to working in the cloud!!

##Thanks for taking the time to read this!
